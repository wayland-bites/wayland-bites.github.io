Let's make the list as comprehensive as possible.

# Data structure

New items should be added to the `xorgfeats` section of `_config.yml`.

Features that are definitely not support by the Wayland implementation, should be marked as `"-"`.

Footnotes can be referenced by their number appended after the `^` sign.

Please check the page on a local Jekyll instance before submitting, the layout may break for really weird reasons sometimes.

Feel free to explain the data structure here if you feel that it's not intuitive enough :P

# Notes

Design improvements are also appreciated.

Active contributors will likely be added as the organization members.

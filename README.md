Let's make the list as comprehensive as possible.

New items should be added at the end of `_config.yml`. Please check the page on a local Jekyll instance before submitting, the layout may break for really weird reasons sometimes.

Feel free to explain the data structure here if you feel that it's not intuitive enough :P

Design improvements are also appreciated.

Active contributors will likely be added as the organization members.
